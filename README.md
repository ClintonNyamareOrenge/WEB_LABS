# üöÄ 40 Days of Web Penetration Testing ‚Äî From Zero to Hero

Welcome to my Web Penetration Testing journey. I‚Äôm dedicating 3 hours daily for 40 days to learn, practice, and document everything I explore in the world of web security. This repository will serve as a public journal of my progress ‚Äî with **weekly reports**, key learnings, tools used, and resources.

## üß† Why I'm Doing This

As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I want to build a solid foundation in web application security, including:
- Understanding how websites and APIs work
- Finding and exploiting common vulnerabilities (like XSS, SQLi, SSRF, etc.)
- Using tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and more
- Practicing responsibly on legal platforms

This repo will track my growth from *absolute beginner to capable web pentester*.
